To run the generator, a user should open the application folder in the terminal and run the following command:

~~~
node index.js
~~~

Users will then be prompted within the terminal for information about their project, including name, description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and contact information for questions. After completing the prompts, a file will be generated in the application folder, titled generated-README.md. This file will be formatted nicely and contain all the information entered by the user, along with a badge showing license information and links to the user's email and GitHub profile.
